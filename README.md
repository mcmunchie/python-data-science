## Purpose
Introduction to the data mining process and its application to real-world problems. Explored data preparation techniques, post-processing metrics to identify information of interest, supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

## Lab 01: Python Review
Review of basic Python functionality and programming.

Python environment setup:
+ [VMware Workstation Player 16](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html) running [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
+ [JetBrains PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)

Alternative Python environment setup:
+ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Lab 02: CDC CSV Data Analysis
Demonstrates data manipulation using a CSV file[^1] from the [CDC database](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailycases). 

## Lab 03: Data Processing and Mining using Pandas
Demonstrates data analysis using Pandas library and CDC COVID-19 data through an API call. It takes awhile to retrieve the data from the CDC database at the start of the program.

## Lab 04: Indicators of Heart Disease and Data Analysis
Explores key indicators of Heart Disease using the following dataset from the [2020 Annual CDC survey data of 400k adults](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease?resource=download).

[^1]: Visit CDC database via the link above, scroll down to the 'Data Downloads and Footnotes' section, click the **plus** icon to expand the 'Data Table for Daily Case Trends - The United States' column, then click the big **Download Data** button. Now you've downloaded the *data_table_for_daily_case_trends__the_united_states* CSV file used in this lab.
